#### Gemma 3n Integration Architecture

```javascript
// Core Gemma 3n Service Implementation
class GemmaService {
  constructor() {
    this.modelConfig = {
      modelSize: '4B',           // Primary model for high accuracy
      submodelSize: '2B',        // Battery-optimized submodel
      maxTokens: 2048,
      temperature: 0.7,
      multimodalCapabilities: [
        'image_understanding',
        'audio_analysis', 
        'text_generation',
        'cross_modal_reasoning'
      ]
    };
  }

  // Multimodal species identification
  async identifySpeciesFromImage(imageUri, location) {
    const analysisResult = await this.model.processMultimodal({
      type: 'image',
      data: imageUri,
      task: 'species_identification',
      context: {
        location: location,
        domain: 'environmental_conservation',
        expertise_level: 'expert'
      }
    });
    
    return this.enrichWithConservationData(analysisResult);
  }

  // Environmental audio analysis
  async analyzeEnvironmentalAudio(audioUri, duration, location) {
    const analysisResult = await this.model.processMultimodal({
      type: 'audio',
      data: audioUri,
      duration: duration,
      task: 'environmental_audio_analysis',
      context: {
        location: location,
        analysis_type: 'biodiversity_assessment'
      }
    });
    
    return this.generateBiodiversityScore(analysisResult);
  }
}
```

### 🔬 Innovative Technical Features

#### 1. Dynamic Model Switching
EcoGuard leverages Gemma 3n's "mix'n'match" capability to dynamically switch between the 4B and 2B models based on:
- Battery level
- Processing complexity
- User preferences
- Network availability

```javascript
// Dynamic model selection based on context
selectOptimalModel(task, deviceState) {
  if (deviceState.batteryLevel < 0.2 && task.complexity === 'low') {
    return this.gemma2B; // Use 2B submodel for battery conservation
  }
  
  if (task.requiresHighAccuracy || deviceState.isPluggedIn) {
    return this.gemma4B; // Use full 4B model for maximum accuracy
  }
  
  return this.adaptiveModel; // Use dynamic sizing
}
```

#### 2. Multimodal Ecosystem Assessment
Unique combination of visual and audio analysis for comprehensive ecosystem health evaluation:

```javascript
async assessEcosystemHealth(imageUri, audioUri, location) {
  const [visualAnalysis, audioAnalysis] = await Promise.all([
    this.analyzeHabitatVisuals(imageUri),
    this.analyzeSoundscape(audioUri)
  ]);
  
  // Cross-modal reasoning using Gemma 3n
  const ecosystemAssessment = await this.model.processMultimodal({
    type: 'multimodal',
    data: { image: imageUri, audio: audioUri },
    task: 'ecosystem_health_assessment',
    context: {
      visual_indicators: visualAnalysis,
      audio_indicators: audioAnalysis,
      location_context: location
    }
  });
  
  return this.generateActionableRecommendations(ecosystemAssessment);
}
```

#### 3. Privacy-First Conservation Data
All sensitive conservation data is processed locally, with optional encrypted sharing:

```javascript
// Privacy-preserving data handling
class PrivacyManager {
  async processConservationData(data, userConsent) {
    // Always process locally first
    const localAnalysis = await this.processLocally(data);
    
    if (userConsent.shareForResearch && !this.isEndangeredSpecies(data)) {
      // Only share non-sensitive data with explicit consent
      await this.shareAnonymizedData(this.anonymize(localAnalysis));
    }
    
    return localAnalysis;
  }
}
```
