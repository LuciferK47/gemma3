## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- React Native development environment
- Expo CLI
- Android Studio / Xcode for device testing

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ecoguard-gemma3n
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Run on device/simulator**
   ```bash
   # For Android
   npm run android
   
   # For iOS
   npm run ios
   
   # For web (development)
   npm run web
   ```

5. **Start the demo server** (for hackathon presentation)
   ```bash
   npm run demo
   ```

### Development Setup

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - The app is designed to work offline-first
   - Gemma 3n integration is currently mocked for demo purposes
   - Real Gemma 3n integration would require model deployment

2. **Database Initialization**
   - SQLite database is automatically initialized on first run
   - Includes sample species data for demonstration

3. **Permissions**
   - Camera access for species identification
   - Microphone access for audio analysis
   - Location access for conservation recommendations

## 📝 Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo framework
- **AI Integration**: Gemma 3n multimodal processing
- **Database**: SQLite for offline data storage
- **Navigation**: React Navigation with tab-based interface
- **UI Components**: React Native Paper for Material Design

### Key Features Implementation
